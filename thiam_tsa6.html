                <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios where players can interact with a fully customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay options allow players to choose the way they play, creating countless possibilities. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011. Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 200 million copies sold across all platforms. There are three actively maintained editions of Minecraft: Java Edition (PC); Bedrock Edition (Windows, mobile, and consoles); and Minecraft Education (for educational settings). There is also a localized release of the game for mainland China.</p>
